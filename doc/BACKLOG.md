Write at least six Use Cases per team member that describe specific features each person expects to complete — these will serve as the project's initial Backlog. Focus on features you plan to complete during the first two Sprints (i.e., the project's highest priority features). Note, they can be similar to those given in the assignment specification, but should include more detail specific to your project's goals. It may help to draw a diagram of how your classes collaborate or even role play the objects for each case.

Creating a new game:

* User clicks on “New Game” button in top right to create new blank game (not one of preset options)

* Button triggers controller event to create a new window for the game

* Brings up default window view with box “Create new game”

* User types game name (ex “tic-tac-toe”) in textbox and selects template option (ex. “mxn grid”) from template dropdown which also becomes tagname.

* String tic-tac-toe is saved as the game name / ID for reference later and to name data files

* Mxn grid tag adds it to mxn game lists where all mxn game datafiles can be loaded as a preset when selecting the game in previous window

* User is provided with a blank editor window with side panel options to add components to the game

Adding a mxn board to the game (example tic-tac-toe to illustrate):

* User clicks on side panel button “add board” to bring up a window where they select the board type

* Button click triggers controller event addboard which tells controller to load board options from backend

* Backend also lists the parameters necessary for each board to ask front end to retrieve

* give these options to frontend to present in the dropdown selection for board templates in pop up box (ex mxn, monopoly…)

* User selects mxn from drop down which causes an update to the window (or a new window view) that then asks for the height and width

* Selection triggers controller to look at the necessary parameters list that backend sent along with the board (height and width)

* Tells abstract front end class that takes a desired parameters list and creates a variable number of text boxes to display variable name and box for response

* User enters 3 and 3 into those boxes to create a tic tac toe board

* These strings are passed into controller which converts them to desired variable there or passes it as strings to backend

* Backend creates the board which is linked with a board ID so frontend and backend know which board they are talking about

* User clicks done to save and return to main screen

Adding players to the game (example tic-tac-toe to illustrate):

* User clicks on button to “add players”

* This brings up window with prompt for entering players info

* User prompted to enter name for players type (some games have players with different roles and abilities) - user enters tic tac toe player (doesn’t matter just for ID)

* User prompted to enter in the minimum number of players and maximum number of players

* This makes it possible that when running the game a variable number of players can play the gave provided within these bounds

* There will be logic ways to get the number of players created, and if the piece belongs to myself or another player

* User selects 2 min and 2 max

* Optional selection to choose colors for each player

* So that pieces can be colored later, to be associated with a player

* This option is provided when creating a piece

* User clicks done to save and return to main screen

Adding pieces to the game (example tic-tac-toe to illustrate):

* User clicks on add pieces

* Controller is triggered which pulls player info from backend

* This is given to frontend to create a window to enter in info

* User prompted to enter the category name of the piece for identification (this should not be specific to the picture of the piece but encapsulates all pieces with the same logic) ex. Boot = car in monopoly (“move tokens”), “knight” is different then “rook” in chess but can have different colors for white and black - user enters “tokens” or “X and O” 

* User selects from dropdown what “players” type already selected the piece belongs to or if its shared and belongs to the game - user chooses “tic tac toe players”

* User clicks on upload button to upload image piece options that can be chosen by each player - they upload “X.png”. After upload this is listed below.

* User clicks on upload button to upload image piece options that can be chosen by each player - they upload “O.png”. After upload this is listed below.

* User clicks “add logic” to define movement of piece which brings up logic editor

Adding logic blocks to define piece path:

* In the logic editor screen for a specific piece



* User selects “define path” tab at the top to define the path
* This opens a new tab view which has the “start path” block at the top of the view
* User can drag in blocks such as forward, back, up, left, right, down, diagonal up right…
    * Once clicked the block image is copied and moved in parallel with the mouse
    * Once released the block image stops moving and appears on the screen
* These blocks appear on the screen when dragged in and connection arrows can be drawn by clicking bottom of block and clicking on the top of another block
* Each of these blocks are correlated by block name to a function in backend that creates a path object and are linked together in sequence based on the arrows to make a path

Changing tabs/windows and going back to piece logic path editor:



* User previously created a diagram of the path logic for a piece
    * The location of all the block objects is stored in the view scene
    * When changing scene, this old scene is saved in the frontend with an ID mapping linked list (piecename ID - path logic tab)
* User changed tabs to either add a new piece or different component and now wants to edit the same piece logic
    * It would be inefficient to redownload logic orientation from saved data file
* User clicks on the desired piece shown in the left panel by its name
    * This triggers an event to look in the scene linked list by the ID key
* This brings up the piece logic homescreen. The user selects the path logic tab.
* This displays the same scene shown before exactly the same way it was left.

Drag and drop or click and place:

Click logicblock or game piece or board piece… object you want to drag in

Button for object is selected - needs to be sent to controller

User moves mouse

User clicks or releases event detected and triggers controller function

FRONTEND detects event mouseClicked() ( or released() ) in the window clicked on and selected



* Mouseclick calls controller function to get mouse coordinates
    * Inputs = mouse coordinates in window, object type from previously selected / dragged
    * Controller calls on backend to create a new object of that type at that location specified by the coordinates
    * It also needs to initialize the imageview of that object centered at the coordinates given
    * There will be some translation to convert coordinates of image view and backend logic
    * The imageview will be added by the controller to the appropriate frontend panel

InitializeObjectOnClick(record double {mouseX,mouseY}, string objectName -> properties to get object):
