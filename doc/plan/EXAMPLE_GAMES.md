# Example games we could implement! (3 total)

Describe in detail at least three example games from your genre or game variations that differ significantly in their functionality. These example games should help clarify the abstractions you plan to use in your design, so explain why you chose them and clearly identify their functional commonalities and differences. Note, they do not need to be the final ones you implement but certainly could be.
