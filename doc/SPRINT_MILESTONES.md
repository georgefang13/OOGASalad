# Rough timeline for project!

Describe your plan for how to manage and prioritize the project, including a rough timeline what you expect to complete for each deadline, the extension feature(s) you want to include, and which APIs each team member plans to take primary and secondary responsibility for. Specifically, each person should take responsibility for specific features and Use Cases they intend to work on during each Sprint (i.e., each week). This requires the team to agree on the feature priorities and set goals for what to complete for each deliverable.
