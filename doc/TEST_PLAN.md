# Description of planning strategies + examples

Describe at least two specific strategies your team discussed to make your APIs more easily testable (such as useful parameters and return values, using smaller classes or methods, throwing Exceptions, etc.). Describe at least three test scenarios per team member for a project feature they plan to be responsible for (at least one of which is negative/sad/error producing), the expected outcome, and how your design supports testing for it (such as methods you can call, specific values you can use as parameters and return values to check, specific expected UI displays or changes that could be checked, etc.). A test scenario describes the expected results from a user's action to initiate a feature in your program (whether "happy" or "sad") and the steps that lead to that result.
